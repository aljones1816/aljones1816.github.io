        , I began tinkering with R programs used to unravel the timing of past
        great climate changes recorded in ocean sediment cores. Since then, I've
        been lucky to have collaborated with Massachusetts energy utilities to
        develop a{" "}

        My goal is to transition full time into full stack web development. I
        find this space fascinating, and keeping up with the relentless pace of
        innovation is exciting. Below you will find a selection of my personal
        projects, mostly built with Typescript.

        In my free time, I love being outdoors hiking or camping with my wife
        and our dog, traveling to new countries, tinkering with tech at home,
        cooking, weightlifting, or bouldering. My background in paleoclimate
        research left me with an indelible drive to understand and bring
        awareness to the reality and threat of climate change, and it is a
        subject I'm very passionate about.
