        My journey into software began in 2015 when, as a graduate student
        studying paleoclimatology, I began tinkering with R programs used to
        unravel the timing of past great climate changes recorded in ocean
        sediment cores. Since then, I've been lucky to have collaborated with
        Massachusetts energy utilities to develop data platforms that drive
        their energy efficiency programs, and to participate in a large-scale
        data warehouse migration.

        My goal is to transition into full stack web development. I find this
        space fascinating, and keeping up with the relentless innovation is
        exciting. Below you will find a selection of personal projects, mostly
        built with Typescript.

        In my free time I love spending time outdoors hiking or camping with my
        wife and our dog, traveling to new countries, tinkering with tech at
        home, cooking, or bouldering. My background in paleoclimate research
        left me with an indelible drive to understand and bring awareness to the
        reality and threat of climate change.
