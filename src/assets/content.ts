  bio: "Hi, I'm Alan. I live in Portland, Maine with my spouse and our little dog, Copper. When I'm not coding and creating bugs for myself to fix, I spend my free time traveling with my partner to see as much of the world as we can, hiking through Maine's beautiful wilderness, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, finding creative ways to injure myself on unfamiliar gym equipment, and getting bodied on the kitchen line at the pickleball court. I'm a passionate advocate for environmental stewardship and deeply believe that climate change is humanity's most critical challenge. I want to use technology to make the world better.",
